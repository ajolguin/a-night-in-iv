#Lisa L. and Patrick V.

(a) (20 pts) A brief description of the project. Here, I'm looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.
* Treasure Hunter is a game where the player walks around a grassy map looking for treasure.

(b) (20 pts) A set of user stories (as a X I can Y so that Z) that describe what the current software in its current state can do.
* As a player I can walk up, down, left, and right on the map.
* As a player I am supposed to find three treasures on the map.
* As a player, when three treasures have been found, I can still explore on the map (and get bored).

(c) (20 pts) A brief assessment of whether the software runs or not. If it runs, briefly describe what it does
* Treasure Hunter runs.
* A little guy appears on the screen and we can move him around.
* When the player finds the treasure, we get a message from on the screen.
* When all the treasures are found, we are still be able to move around the map.

(d) (20 pts) A set of user stories (at least 2, but you are encouraged to write up to 4 or more if you can, as many as you think is reasonable) about features that COULD be added to the software to make it more useful, fun, better, etc.
* As a player, I should find useful treasure, like weapons or magic spells
* As a player, I should have to avoid enemies and traps on the map.
* Player should have more map area to explore.
* Play a sound when treasure is found
* Player should know when they find all the treasure on the map.
* This might be kind of crazy but what if we use LWJGL for graphics :o ??

(e) (20 pts) An assessment of the current quality of the README.md. What information could be added to make it easier for the next generation of folks maintaining this code to use the software, and/or maintain the software?
* README.md is decent content-wise, but could benefit from some nicer formatting and punctuation.
* Also by pointing out some futher information about the method that need to be edited on will be a nice work. 

(f) (20 pts) An assessment of the current state of the build.xml file. Are there targets that need descriptions? Is there old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed? (More on this below).
* build.xml looks pretty well documented and clean. All targets have descriptions and make sense

(g) (20 pts) An assessment of the current “issues”. Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this project? Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?
* Yeah, we have enough issues to work on. And the issues is quite clear on what we are expected by!
* The issues mostly focus on improving the functionality of the existing code

(h) (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough.
* [Add a timer](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-treasure-hunter/issues/32)
* [Expand the map](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-treasure-hunter/issues/33)

(i) (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code. Write a bit about how the code is organized. Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear? Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another? Is the code easy to read and understand? If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just “one screenful of text” to help that programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?
* There are only 5 classes, so if we want to expand the game we will need to refactor the class hierarchy. 
* Class relations are pretty obvious, especially since there are just 3 main ones to consider.
* The code isn't too bad, we had an easy time understanding most of it.
* For my one screenful of text I would explain the main relationships between GameComponent, Player, and GameGui as follow
```
*/
The GameComponent is extend from JComponent, which draws all of the tiles on the map and loads the player sprite.
The GameGui's job is to maintain the basic stuff of the frame and window. Also it is used to add treasures on the map and enable the user to control the player.
The Player class on the other hand has the variable of a player and an constructor to instantiation a player
*/
```

(j) (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test coverage? Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing? Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?
* There are JUnit tests for class Player but not for anything else. We could expand test coverage by making tests for all the existing classes and their eventual child-classes. The way I would go about it is solidify the existing functionality and dig for any hidden bugs, then expand the tests based on the new classes we'll eventually start implementing.
